				<p>I Started MoonLit Lounge to help other people become a success. Being a former YouTuber I know the difficulties of being discovered. This is why my goal and my teams goal is to help those interconnect with each other and be able to connect better. After starting MoonLit Lounge and using these tools I created myself I have grown to see a bigger part of YouTube</p>
